# PixelProject v3

This is a Rust project using Bevy, the 3rd of its kind. The [first](https://github.com/SimplyJpk/PixelProject) and [second](https://github.com/SimplyJpk/PixelProject-v2) were C++ projects originally used as an excuse to refine my C++ knowledge. The current project is a variant written in Rust to improve my understanding and ability to use the language more than just being able to read it.

Inspired after playing Noita and watching the [GDC video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prXuyMCgbTc) presented by the developers.
